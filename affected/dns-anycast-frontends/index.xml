&lt;p>(Is there any good in it? &amp;ndash; If you will, yes: being targeted for DDoS speaks to the maturity of the platform. It is true for all DNS providers that the day of DoS arrives eventually.

The issue was caused by incomplete replication of zones after their DNSSEC signatures had been renewed, leading to DNSSEC validation failures for certain DNS queries.
Impact No data was lost or compromised: our services were not under attack, nor did a physical failure occur.
Signatures on domains that had not been updated since May 28, 2020, were not correctly refreshed. As a consequence, DNSSEC-aware clients or resolvers rejected those expired signatures.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>deSEC DNS operations experienced a partial service disruption.

&lt;p>DNS clients or resolvers that do not perform DNSSEC validation were not affected and were able to query all domains at any time.&lt;/p>
