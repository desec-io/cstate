&lt;p>No data was lost or compromised: our services were not under attack, nor did a physical failure occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Signatures on domains that had not been updated since May 28, 2020, were not correctly refreshed. As a consequence, DNSSEC-aware clients or resolvers rejected those expired signatures. Domains whose contents had been updated more recently were provisioned correctly on the frontend DNS servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DNS clients or resolvers that do not perform DNSSEC validation were not affected and were able to query all domains at any time.&lt;/p>
