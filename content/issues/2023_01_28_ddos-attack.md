DNS frontends are currently experiencing extraordinary load due to an ongoing DDoS attack. We will update this notice once the problem has been resolved.

As this is not the first incident, we will deploy more resources throughout the upcoming weeks, leading to a significant increase of the number of global server locations and their capabilities to cope with high load. We hope that this will prevent further attacks from succeeding.
