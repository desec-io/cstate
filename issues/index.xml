The issue occurred due to the Docker daemon not properly restarting after a scheduled update. All web services (web site, API, and dynDNS update interface) were hence interrupted.
deSEC operates a monitoring system to alert our team in such cases. The system worked properly and alerted us at 5:25am UTC.

The issue happened due to a scheduled update of our Docker daemon, a piece of software that we use to run several of our components. After the Docker update, one of the Docker containers was not restarted as configured, and as a result, our main web server (which depends on the failing container) also did not start up.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>deSEC API and web services have been unavailable today between 4:26am and 10:13am UTC.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>deSEC operates a monitoring system that is supposed to alert our team in case of such events (by escalating through email, text messages, and phone calls within about 10 minutes). The detection of the error condition worked as intended, but the alerting did not occur. We suspect this to be due to a configuration edge case. In response to this, we will thoroughly review and retest our alerting configuration.&lt;/p>

The issue was caused by incomplete replication of zones after their DNSSEC signatures had been renewed, leading to DNSSEC validation failures for certain DNS queries.
Impact No data was lost or compromised: our services were not under attack, nor did a physical failure occur.
Signatures on domains that had not been updated since May 28, 2020, were not correctly refreshed. As a consequence, DNSSEC-aware clients or resolvers rejected those expired signatures.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>deSEC DNS operations experienced a partial service disruption.

&lt;p>Signatures on domains that had not been updated since May 28, 2020, were not correctly refreshed. As a consequence, DNSSEC-aware clients or resolvers rejected those expired signatures. Domains whose contents had been updated more recently were provisioned correctly on the frontend DNS servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DNS clients or resolvers that do not perform DNSSEC validation were not affected and were able to query all domains at any time.&lt;/p>
